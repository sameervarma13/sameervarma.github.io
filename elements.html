        <h1>NBA Team Classifier</h1>
      </header> <br /><br />

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Investigate what factors distinguish the successful teams in the NBA
        and to create model to predict playoff success.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Data was scraped from
        <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">
          basketball-reference
        </a>.
        Basic and advanced metric statistics were collected by scraping specific
        tables. The data was then cleaned so a single dataframe represented a
        single season where the columns were the various statistics, and the
        rows were the 30 NBA teams. Initially, when working with data from only
        the past 10 years, the data was collected manually by downloading the
        tables and then merging them. Labeling the data with each team's playoff
        result was particularly time consuming when done manually. However,
        eventually it became clear that collecting data from several years past
        would be much more beneficial. Thus a scraper was implemented to easily
        automate the process and allow for data collection from the last 50+
        years.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Initial Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        There were 58 different statistics used to measure each team during each
        season. Correlation Heat Maps were constructed to observe the
        relationships between the feature variables, as well as the change in
        correlation between features over time. For example, the correlation
        between points scored and three pointers made rises steadily from
        1980(0.1) to 1990(0.28) to 2000(0.45) to 2010(0.54) to 2015(0.65) where
        it then begins to level off.

            width="430"
          />
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="image right2">
          <img
            src="images/heat_2015.png"

            width="430"

      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      <hr />

      <h2>Principal Component Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        With 58 feature variables for each team it was important to determine
        which variables caused the largest variance between the different teams.
        In order to do that, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on
        the individual season data and then later on groups of seasons. To
        visually observe each team data point both 2 and 3 principal components
        were used. The resulting graphs showed that non-playoff teams were
        consistently clustered quite well together and the 1st, 2nd, and
        Conference Final teams are reasonably well clustered together. Principal
        Component 1 captured a majority of the variance (43% and 40%).

      <h2>Model Building (K-Nearest Neighbors)</h2>
      <p>
        Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a classifier was used to predict the
        playoff results from the years 1980-2018. For this classifier it was
        determined that 5 neighbors produced the optimal results. The training
        data used was the original data with 58 features (not the PCA data). The
        training data consisted of data from years 1980-2018. Then 5 fold cross
        validation was performed to assess the model's ability to successfully
        predict unseen data. The mean score from the cross validation was 56%.
        It is worth noting that predicting every team to be 'DNQ' would yield
        ~46% accuracy.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h2>Model Building (Random Forest)</h2>
      <p>
        Next, a Random Forest classifier was used. Once again, the training data
        used was the original data of 58 features consisting of the years
        1980-2018. 5 fold Cross Validation was performed again. The mean score
        here was slightly higher at 61% and the most important feature in the
        classifier was SRS (margin of victory, adjusted for strength of
        schedule).
      </p>
      <hr />

	  <h2>Model Building (Manual Kmeans Cluster)</h2>
	  <p>
		What I noticed about the predictions from both the KNN and Random Forest
		classifiers was that certain labels were never issued when predicting
		one or even two seasons worth of data. A majority of the data points
		were labeled as DNQ, 1st Round, or 2nd Round. Many times, a champion
		would never be predicted. When predicting a single season, it is known
		how many teams fall into each 'cluster': 14 DNQs, 8 1st Rounds, 4 2nd
		Rounds, 2 Conference Finals, and 1 Champion.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I wanted to take this into account. Using the PCA data from 1980-2018
		consisting of 5 columns: PC1, PC2, PC3, Year, Playoff Result, I found
		the cluster centroid for each of the labels (DNQ, 1st Round, etc.).
		While calculating this, the test data was left out by dropping the
		entries belonging to a certain year. Then the test data was introduced
		and for each team data point, a distance was calculated from that data
		point to all 5 cluster centroids. Finally, the appropriate number of data
		points, corresponding to the cluster size, were assigned to each label
		by finding the data points with the shortest distance to the centroids.

	  <h2>Conclusions/Results</h2>
	  <p>
		Three different classification models were used: KNN, Random Forest, and a manual Kmeans Cluster. Given that predicting every team as 'DNQ' would yield a ~46% accuracy, all the models scored quite low.

		The Random Forest Classifier outperformed the other models slightly overall, but the KNN (Standard Data) model was the best at predicting the correct Champion. Surprisingly, the KNN Classifier trained and predicted on the Standard data performed better than when used on the PCA data. While the manual Kmeans Cluster (DNQ First) was more accurate than both KNN models overall, it was the worst at predicting the champion. It actually got none correct.

	  <p>
		The manual Kmeans Cluster (Champion First) performed the worst overall and (expectedly) performed better at picking the Champion than Kmeans Cluster (DNQ First). However, many of the incorrect labels given by Kmeans Cluster (Champion First) were 'DNQ', which is as wrong a prediction as possible.

          <h1>Enron Email Analysis</h1>
        </header> <br /><br />
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>
          Complete an exploratory analysis for the Enron email dataset to
          identify intersting trends in the data.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>
          The enron email dataset was downloaded from Kaggle as a CSV file. The
          raw data consisted of a few columns and a message column. The message
          field contained all the necessary information about each email such as
          the sender, recipient, time, and actual message content. The best way
          to store all information appropriately would be to have a column for
          each field (from, to, date, message, cc, etc.). Because the original
          message column containing all the information was in the form of a key
          value pair, the keys were extracted as the main fields and the value
          was the appropriate value for each field. Thus a final dataframe was
          created with the keys being the new column headers and the values
          being the associated rows. Finally the 'Date' column was converted to
          a Datetime object for later analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Initial Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The first step was to observe the emails addressess contributing most
          to the dataset. To do this, the email addresses found most frequently
          in the 'From' column and the 'To' column were identified. These emails
          would be those who sent and received the most emails.

        <h2>Date Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The first part of the exploratory analysis consisted of looking at who
          was sending and receiving the most emails. Because the 'Date' column
          was converted to a Datetime object in the cleaning process, the
          specific day of the week and date of each Datetime object could be
          extracted. To get the total emails sent per day, the rows were
          iterated through and each corresponding day of the week was
          appropriately incremented. To find the average per day, it was
          important to find the number of distinct Mondays, Tuesdays, etc. Then
          the total from each day could be divided by the number of distinct
          days and finally plotted.

        <h2>Graph Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Because the email dataset consists of a 'from' and 'to' column, one way
          to visually model the data is through a graph, specifically an
          undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents each email address
          and the edges represent every email sent between various email
          addresses.

        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of the white pieces is to get the King piece to the edge
          of the board. The black pieces try to capture the king before it
          reaches the edge. The 16 black pieces start the game first. The white
          pieces, with the king at the center of the board, move next and the
          two sides alternate turns. All pieces move like chess rooks, any
          number of squares vertically or horizontally. No piece can occupy the
          same square as another piece and no piece can be 'jumped'. No piece
          other than the king may land on the middle square. Capturing commonly
          occurs by sandwiching an enemy piece on two opposite sides. The king
          is captured like any other piece except for when it is on the center
          piece or any of the four orthogonally adjacent squares. In this
          situation the king must be surrounded on all four sides by enemy
          pieces.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>Game Design</h2>
        <p>
          The first step of the project was to design the board and the
          necessary data structures to store information about the current state
          of the board, the pieces, and the possible moves. Then all the rules
          for the game were implemented. The interesting part of the project was
          designing the AI agent. This was done by using the Minimax algorithm
          and alpha-beta pruning. Essentially, the current state of the board is
          sent to a heuristic function which returns a low score if the board is
          favorable to the black player and a high score if favorable to the
          white player. This heuristic function takes into account the location
          of the king and the number of pieces remaining. If the move results in
          a win, the score is set to a maximum. A game tree is constructed where
          edges represent moves and nodes represent the score. When the depth
          limit is reached or a node is a winning move, the algorithm picks the
          optimal path. Using this approach, the AI can detect a winning
          sequence within a few moves.
